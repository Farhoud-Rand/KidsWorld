Overview:
The Kids World Website is an online platform designed to provide a safe and engaging environment for children to explore and enjoy a wide variety of stories that are suitable for children of various ages. The platform allows administrators to curate and manage stories, while users can discover, read, and interact with the content. With a focus on simplicity, creativity, and interactivity, the platform aims to foster a love for reading and storytelling among young audiences.
our website is simple, for the admin we use CRUD operations with stories, we used Django framework with python for the back-end side, as for the front-end and interactivity we designed it with html, css, bootstrap, javascript, ajax with js, sweet alert and animations with javascript, we used many techniques to make our website interacts with the users.
